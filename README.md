# Carousel-3D
Carousel menu that moves the items based on your mouse movements and simulates a 3D effect using 2D images.

Lee Brimelow made a tutorial about this using Flash and ActionScript 2 back when he had GoToAndLearn.com and I tought it would be interesting to share the source code and also publish an ActionScript 3 version of the carousel.
